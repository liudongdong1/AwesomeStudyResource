you can find more course xmind picture in directory CourseXmindHighSummary.And what's more, you can find the detail lectures in the directory course.And in the directories like Algorithm and paper ,i will add the algorithm code and the paper i have learned in the future.And I sincerely hope you join us to share your learning resouce as well.

if you think it's OK,,you can donate some,for  I'm a junior major in IOT,who loan about 25,600 yuan for study .
